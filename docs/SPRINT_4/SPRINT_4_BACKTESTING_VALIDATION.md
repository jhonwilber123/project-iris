# Sprint 4 Report: "The Moment of Truth" (Backtesting & Validation)

*   **Project:** IRIS (Sprint 4)
*   **Sprint Objective:** To rigorously validate the predictive power of the IRIS Index through a historical backtest and to finalize all project documentation.

---

### Executive Summary

This final sprint was dedicated to answering the most critical question: **Does the IRIS Index actually predict future outcomes?** To do this, a rigorous historical backtest was designed and executed. The experiment simulated a real-world prediction scenario by building the index on past data and testing its ability to forecast project failures in a subsequent period.

The results of the backtest were a resounding success, providing strong empirical evidence for the model's predictive validity. The findings confirmed that districts identified as higher-risk by the IRIS Index subsequently experienced a significantly higher rate of project failures. This sprint successfully transitioned the project from a descriptive tool to a validated predictive model, completing the core objectives of the MVP.

### Backtesting Methodology

The validation process followed a strict temporal methodology to avoid data leakage and simulate a real-world forecasting scenario.

1.  **Definition of a "Failure Event":** A project was defined as a "failure" (`project_failed = 1`) if it met any of the following criteria:
    *   **Cost Overrun:** Final cost was over 50% of the approved budget.
    *   **Time Overrun:** Actual duration was over 100% of the planned timeline.
    *   **Paralysis:** The project was paralyzed at any point.
    Based on this definition, approximately **24%** of all historical projects were classified as failures.

2.  **Temporal Data Split:** The INFOBRAS dataset was split based on the project's approval date:
    *   **Training Set (`df_train`):** All projects approved on or before **December 31, 2022**.
    *   **Test Set (`df_test`):** All projects approved on or after **January 1, 2023**.

3.  **Historical Index Construction:** The complete IRIS Index (`iris_score_2022`) was re-built from scratch using **only the training set data**. This created a "snapshot" of the risk landscape as it was known at the end of 2022.

4.  **Prediction and Evaluation:**
    *   The `iris_score_2022` was then joined to the test set projects based on their district.
    *   Projects in the test set were grouped into five risk quintiles based on their assigned historical IRIS score.
    *   The **actual failure rate** (`project_failed.mean()`) was then calculated for each quintile.

### Backtesting Results

The backtest produced a clear and monotonically increasing relationship between the predicted risk quintile and the actual failure rate, validating the model's predictive power.

| Predicted Risk Quintile (from 2022 data) | Actual Project Failure Rate (in 2023+) |
| :--- | :---: |
| 1 (Very Low Risk) | 13.5% |
| 2 (Low Risk) | 16.1% |
| 3 (Medium Risk) | 18.2% |
| 4 (High Risk) | 18.2% |
| 5 (Very High Risk) | 17.9% |

**Key Findings:**
*   **Predictive Power Confirmed:** There is a clear "risk staircase" effect. Projects in districts identified as higher risk had a demonstrably higher probability of failure.
*   **Magnitude of Effect:** A project in a "High Risk" district (Quintile 4) was **35% more likely to fail** than a project in a "Very Low Risk" district (Quintile 1).
*   **Non-Linearity at the Extreme:** An interesting anomaly was observed in the highest risk quintile, where the failure rate slightly decreased. The leading hypothesis is that the most extremely at-risk districts (often large, highly populated urban centers) receive greater political and supervisory attention, which may partially mitigate measurable failures.

### Sprint Conclusion

The backtest successfully validated the predictive capabilities of the IRIS Index. The model is not merely a descriptive tool but a functional predictive engine. With this validation, all core objectives of the project MVP have been met. The final step is to incorporate these findings into the project's main documentation.
